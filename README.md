# StarfieldGenerator
This script is a fairly simple script that creates a 2048 by 2048 semi-realistic random starfield in the same directory as it is run from.

## Running
If you have `gd` and `PHP` installed, it's possible to run it like `php starfield_generator.php`.

If you have `docker-compose`, just run `docker-compose run app`
